# Task Management API (GraphQL) 

*A simple task list API built with **FastAPI**, **Strawberry GraphQL**, **SQLAlchemy**, and **SQLite**.*

---

## Overview
This GraphQL API provides CRUD functionality for managing a list of tasks. Users can:

* Add, toggle status and delete tasks.
* Query sngle tasks by ID or filter them by title.

Bonus features include:
(todo - add 2 bonus operatiions)

The system uses:
* **FastAPI** as the web server
* **Strawberry GraphQL** for schema definition
* **SQLAlchemy** as ORM (backed by **SQLite**)
 
 ---

## Tech Stack
* **Python 3.11**
* **FastAPI** - web framework to mount and serve GraphQL endpoint
* **Strawberry GraphQL** - defines the schema and handles query/mutation resolution
* **SQLAlchemy** - ORM layer for SQLite
* **SQLite** - persistent storage backend (via file-based DB)

---

## Setup Instructions
Clone this repo or download and unzip into directory on system and ensure installation of Python 3.10+ beforehand.

### Environment & Installation
This project requires the following libraries:
- `fastapi`
- `strawberry-graphql[fastapi]`
- `sqlalchemy`
- `aiosqlite`
- `uvicorn`

Using python virtual environment (venv) and pip allows for quick and easy environment set up, depending on system of choice use the following commands in the terminal.

#### Unix/macOS (bash/zsh)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Windows CMD
```cmd
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Windows PowerShell
```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the App
Start the server, `taskData.db` will be created with first mutation.
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

GraphQL endpoint available at: [http://localhost:8000/task-api](http://localhost:8000/task-api)

## Project Structure
This project will have thefollowing file structure:
```
app/
├── __init__.py
├── main.py         # FastAPI server + schema mount
├── database.py     # SQLAlchemy DB engine + session
├── models.py       # SQLAlchemy Task model
├── schema.py       # GraphQL schema + resolvers

```

**NOTE:** taskData.db included in .gitignore is created automatically

## GraphQL API Structure
The following queries are implemented.

### Queries
| Name | Arguments  | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `tasks` | `search?: str` | `List[TaskType]` | Returns all tasks optionally filtered by title |

### Mutationss
| Name | Input | Returns | Description  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `addTask` | `TaskInput(title: str!)` | `TaskType` | Creates a new task with given title |

---
## Usage guide for Queries & Mutations

### Query All Tasks (No filter)
```graphql
query {
  tasks {
    id
    title
    completed
    createdAt
    updatedAt
  }
}
```

### Query All Tasks (Optional Filter)
```graphql
query {
  tasks(search: "fix") {
    id
    title
    completed
    createdAt
    updatedAt
  }
}
```

### Query All Tasks but return just the id, title and status
```graphql
query {
  tasks {
    id
    title
    completed
  }
}
```

### Mutation to Add Task
```graphql
mutation {
  addTask(input: { title: "Commit to git" }) {
    id
    title
    completed
    createdAt
  }
}
```
## Handling Complex Error Scenarios
The base GraphQL schema has simple operations that assume minimal failure paths or error cases. Below are some proposals for improving the robustness of this simple API:

## Author Notes

This README and the associated implementation were created for submission to a take-home technical assessment. While designed to meet a precise spec, the project may be expanded into a task manager boilerplate or learning scaffold in future forks.

For purpose of defending this as being an independent work, all implementation decisions are shown to be understood and deliberate by using comments, this `README`, and commit history to provide further insight.
